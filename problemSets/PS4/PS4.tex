\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We're interested in modeling the historical causes of infant mortality. We have data from 5641 first-born in seven Swedish parishes 1820-1895. Using the "infants" dataset in the \texttt{eha} library, fit a Cox Proportional Hazard model using mother's age and infant's gender as covariates. Present and interpret the output.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=31, lastline=44]{PS4.R}

First, we assign a survival object for the children using entry, exit, and event data to the age of 15. We are then able to get a graph of the total population's survival rate. As seen below. 
 
\includegraphics{Rplot1.pdf}

We are also able to graph the difference in survival rates between males and females.

\includegraphics{Rplot3.pdf} 

The next stage is to fit a Cox Proportional Hazard Model, which we do with the following code. 

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=51, lastline=54]{PS4.R}

There is a 0.0822 decrease in the expected log of the hazard for female babies compared to male babies, holding m.age constant. There is a 0.0076 increase in the expected log of the hazard for babies of mothers with one extra unit of age, holding sex constant. We also note that m.age has a p-value that is statistically significant, as is the p-vlaue for gender.

The hazard ratio of female babies is 0.9210739 that of male babies. This means that for every 100 male babies that die, we would expect that only ~ 92 female babies would die. This could be interrupted in another sense as female babies have a 8 percent lower death rate than equivalent male babies.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=66, lastline=66]{PS4.R}
The hazard ratio of a mother aged 0 is 1.0076466, this number is not quite accurate as no mother can have a child a age zero but it does allow us to analyse a one unit increase in age, and its affect on infant mortality. This could be interrupted in another sense as for each unit increase in a mothers age, the chance of that child dying is 0.7 percent higher than if the mother was one unit of age younger. 

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=71, lastline=72]{PS4.R}

We now graph the two covariets in our model. Which shows that as age increase the bounds of certinly also expand.  

\includegraphics{Rplot4.pdf}

We now will run an interaction model to compare with additive model.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=82, lastline=86]{PS4.R}
 
There is a 0.127105 decrease in the expected log of the hazard for female babies compared to male babies, holding m.age constant.

There is a 0.006963 increase in the expected log of the hazard for babies of mothers with one extra unit of age, holding sex constant. However the P-Values are at level that they are not statistically significant when compared to the additive model.

The hazard ratio of a mother aged 0 is 0.8806412 that of male babies. This means that for every 100 male babies that die, we would expect that only ~ 88 female babies would die. This could be interrupted in another sense as female babies have a 8 percent lower death rate than equivalent male babies.

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=97, lastline=86]{PS4.R}

The hazard ratio of a mother aged 0 is 1.006987, this number is not quite accurate as no mother can have a child a age zero but it does allow us to analyse a one unit increase in age, and its affect on infant mortality. This could be interrupted in another sense as for each unit increase in a mothers age, the chance of that child dying is 0.6987 percent higher than if the mother was one unit of age younger.

While the interactive model had a Chisq value of 0.10623, and the additive has a value of 9.464. The P values in the additive model were statisically significant and better explain the covariets affect on child mortality in this case.
